# CLIMATE CONTROLLED GREENHOUSE BY ARDUINO
Project using Arduino to introduce smart greenhouse.
Today agriculture is changing in response to the requirements of modern society, where ensuring food supply through practices such as water conservation, reduction of agrochemicals and the required planted surface, which guarantees high quality crops are in demand. Greenhouses have proven to be a reliable solution to achieve these goals; however, a greenhouse as a means for protected agriculture has the potential to lead to serious problems. The most of these are related to the inside greenhouse climate conditions where controlling the temperature and relative humidity (RH) are the main objectives of engineering. Achieving appropriate climate conditions to ensure high yield and quality crops reducing energy consumption have been the objective of investigations for some time. Our system is used to control the climate inside the greenhouse. Indeed Greenhouses are considered as too difficult to maintain as the temperature needs continuous monitoring. As of today farmers are forced to appoint labor for monitoring the climate. This system would help farmers to control the climates of the greenhouse effortlessly by using various controlling units as they get instructions from Arduino. Arduino is the heart of the system which is coded according to the climate measures we want. Therefore, when the conditions fail Arduino would generate the signals for maintaining those variations and fix them as fast as they can. This system will be more functional and responsive instead of affording the labor. Here we have the hardware control units which are exactly appropriate for the corresponding climate variations. So the response from the Arduino will be executed successfully by the fans and motors. The changes like Temperature, Humidity, Light, and Soil will be recovered by the controlling units such as fans, sprays and heaters. Arduino works as a heart which can pump every unit that is connected to it. Every single change captured by the sensors will be responded to by Arduino as soon as possible. Greenhouses are considered as sensitive to climate fluctuations which can cause the plants affected, So that the farmers are eager to correct even the small changes.
